# Assignment 1

## Steps to use the StaMp implementation:

- Navigate to the 'library' directory in the submitted folder.
- The stamp.o and then libstamp.so file can be generated by running the `make` command
- Now run `make` command in the 'examples' directory of the submitted folder.
- This will generate 3 binaries, 'fib', 'vector' and 'matrix'.
- The binaries will be executed after setting the ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` environment variable. To set the environment variable enter the command: ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../library```
- Now, inside the 'examples' directory, simply run the executables as:

  ```./fib```

  ```./vector```

  ```./matrix```
